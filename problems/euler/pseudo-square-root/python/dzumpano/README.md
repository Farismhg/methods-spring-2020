# Psuedo Square Roots
## Problem
'The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.
The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.
We shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed the square root of n the pseudo square root (PSR) of n.
It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.
Let p be the product of the primes below 190.
Find PSR(p) mod 10^16.'

## How To Run
If you do not yet have a C complier, i would recomend installing MinGW
Once you have a C complier, run the command:
$ gcc psr.c -o psr -lm
$ ./psr.exe

## Running Recomendations
I would recomend not running it however becasue it is extremely ineffecient and takes quite a while to find the solution.
