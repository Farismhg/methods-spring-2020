------- Solution Explanation --------

My solution for the problem of "Creating a new language" utilizes a switch
statement to store the values for the new language characters. 

Since all characters that do not have a translation are required to stay the 
same, there is a default case that handles all other characters not included
in the new language.

The user enters a string and the string is sent to a translate method and
split by characters to then be translated.

The translate method uses a switch statement to translate character by 
character and appends the new characters to a new string that contains
the translated sentence. The translate then returns this completed string to 
main and prints it.

------ Local Enviornment --------

The program requires a java ide to be run

------ Running the Code --------

Once the program is in an ide, it can be run and will function with any 
form of user input and give the desired translated output
